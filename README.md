# Dumb Charger
Dumb charger is uhm.. dumb, it charges if you tell it to, but it will also stop when you tell it to\
*It's also scared of light and that may scare it enough to stop charging*

### What??
The project is simple electronics to allow you to customize how much you want to charge your phone and when, it requires custom electronics between your charger and your phone but if you like DIY this is a pretty simple project

### How does it work?
It works by using an LDR (light dependent resistor) and a microcontroller and the app on your phone, the app will signal the charger to stop or start depending on your battery level by blinking the builtin flash
